## Real-Time Fraud Detection System
ðŸ”· Phase 1: Data Streaming & Feature Engineering
Goal: Set up a real-time data pipeline to process transaction data.
âœ… Step 1: Simulate a stream of transactions (Kafka Producer) (Pub /sub on GCP)
âœ… Step 2: Preprocess data in real-time with Flink (e.g., feature aggregation, encoding) (Dataflow on GCP)
âœ… Step 3: Store processed features in Redis for fast retrieval
âœ… Step 4:Store Data in BigQuery for Monitoring: Create a BigQuery dataset (fraud_detection)
Set up a Dataflow job to write fraud logs to BigQuery

ðŸ”· Phase 2: Model Development & Optimization
Goal: Train a fraud detection model that balances accuracy and speed.
âœ… Step 4: Train XGBoost/LightGBM on a fraud dataset (e.g., Kaggle Credit Card Fraud)
âœ… Step 5: Convert model for efficient inference (ONNX/TensorRT)
âœ… Step 6: Deploy model using Triton Inference Server

ðŸ”· Phase 3: Real-Time Inference & Monitoring
Goal: Deploy the system with low latency inference and monitoring.
âœ… Step 7: Create a FastAPI service to call the fraud detection model
âœ… Step 8: Integrate Kafka Consumer for real-time inference
âœ… Step 9: Set up Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring

We need: (1) a data ingestion layer using Kafka/PubSub for real-time data or Airflow for batch, (2) a feature store like Feast for online and offline feature consistency, (3) a model training pipeline with distributed training using Vertex AI/Kubeflow, (4) model serving via TensorFlow Serving, and (5) monitoring with Prometheus to detect drift. Given my background in ML model deployment and inference optimization, Iâ€™d focus on ensuring model retraining integrates seamlessly with the pipeline.
